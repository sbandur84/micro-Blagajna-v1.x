installed In all cases Java JRE MUST be installed and running properly for 
uniCenta oPOS to run.

On 64bit platforms; You may receive an error that javaw.exe cannot be found
when trying to run uniCenta oPOS. This is usually caused by having selected
the Java JRE if located in the :\Program Files(x86)\Java folder hence it
cannot be found in the Windows PATH settings.
