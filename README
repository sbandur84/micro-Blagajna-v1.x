Welcome to the uniCenta oPOS family.

uniCenta oPOS Point Of Sale is open source and free software licensed to you under the GNU GPL 3 license
It is a commercial-grade quality product and your use is not restricted in any way.
It can scale from a single machine on your counter-top to tens and tens of terminals in different locations.

uniCenta oPOS is used all around the world and it's become a favourite for a wide-range of businesses
not just because it’s free, but because of its ease of use, exceptional flexibility and reliability.

So let's get you started!
The key to making sure you get the best out of uniCenta oPOS is: Set-up.

Have some patience when you first start out and try to follow these simple steps...

1. Make sure you have the correct Java JRE Runtime installed for your Operating System. 
    If you're running Windows x64 use Java for x64, not the x86 version, and it's running properly.

2. Fire-up unicenta oPOS and head straight for the Configuration panel.
    Settings are here for everything from Databases through to Credit Card processing gateways.

3. Set Roles and Users - we've already created four for you.
    If you set a Password for the Administrator account. Make sure you remember it!

4. Set Taxes
    uniCenta oPOS comes with two Rate types already created: Exempt and Standard. Have as many as you want.

5. Create Categories. Use Categories to group your Products. This controls your Sales screen button layout.
   A default Category is already there. You can rename it and go on to create as many as you need.

7. Create Products. Probably the most important part in uniCenta oPOS you need to get right.
   Assign everything here from Barcodes through to Sales screen button images and fancy looking text. 

8. Edit your Printer Receipt Tickets. There are several templates to choose from. 
   Have your store logo to hand and a good idea of your receipt layout before you start.

9. Play with uniCenta oPOS first. Get to know it. Take your time. Don't rush.
   You will be up & running with uniCenta oPOS in not time compared to other systems.

10.All done! You're ready to deploy in your store. Now take a Backup!
   Always better to do it now rather starting over again or trying to unravel mistakes later when trading.
